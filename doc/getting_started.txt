APEX development: getting started
---------------------------------

- We use Git for version control. Read about it here:
http://git-scm.com/documentation

- We use Gerrit for code review. Read about it here:
http://gerrit-documentation.googlecode.com/svn/Documentation/2.6/index.html
Information about our local setup is in the file using_gerrit.txt in the current directory
To give you access to the gerrit server, we need to add your RSA public key to the list. The server is only accessible from inside KULeuven (or via VPN or SSH tunnel).

- Read about the coding style we use in the file coding_style.txt. Not all of the code in APEX complies to these guidelines yet, but all new code should.

- Compilation instructions are in 00compiling.txt. If these steps don't work for you, it's probably due to new versions of some libraries. In that case please update the file.

- To build APEX, we use the CLEBS system. It it written using qmake. Read about qmake here:
http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-4.8/qmake-manual.html
If you want to change certain settings or paths, you need to copy localconfig-template.pri to localconfig.pri and make the desired changes. Do not commit localconfig.pri.

- Before starting to develop APEX, you should understand how it works from a user's point of view. Read the APEX paper first (cf. doc/manual/apexpaper.pdf). Also check out the manual (cf. doc/manual/apex3manual.pdf). The current version of the manual is incomplete (does not cover all features) and the XML examples are slightly outdated. Then try out some of the examples (cf. examples/) and study the corresponding XML files.

- APEX consists of a simple executable (apexrunner), which only loads the libraries, various libraries, and a whole bunch of plugins. We currently have the following libraries:
-- apexdata: all data structures, does not depend on other libraries
-- apextools: various stand-alone tools, does not depens on other libraries
-- apexwriters: classes to write data structures to XML files
-- streamapp: audio library, to be removed later on
-- syllib: various signal processing clases
-- psiginfit: psychometric curve fitting
-- apexmain: everything else (parts of this library such as GUI, parsers, ... should be split into separate libraries), depends on all other libraries

- For all new code, and code to be refactored, we aim to have reasonable unit test coverage. Unit tests can be found in src/testbench/. We use the QTestLib framework. Read about it here:
http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-4.8/qtestlib-manual.html

- To provide test coverage for older code without unit tests, we use a bash-script that automatically lets APEX run through a set of example experiments, records the audio output and result files, and compares them to a "gold standard". The script can be found in build/tools/test-apex.sh. This script and the unit tests should run successfully after each change to the APEX codebase.

- If you use Qt Creator, you will see that a terminal pops up when you try to run the program/tests/... But this terminal doesn't
do anything. To fix this, go to "Projects" -> "Run Settings" and make sure that "Run in terminal" isn't active. Then try to run
again and normally the program will be run in the "Application Output" of Qt Creator where it will actually work.
