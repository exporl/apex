1.1. Libraries

2 Compilation and installation

2.1. Linux

2.1.1. Required development packages on ubuntu

You should install the required packages with the following command (works on Ubuntu 14.04):
    sudo aptitude install qtbase5-dev-tools qt5-default qt5-qmake portaudio19-dev \
        libxml2-dev chrpath libqt5scripttools5 libqt5xmlpatterns5 \
        libqt5xmlpatterns5-dev qtscript5-dev libqt5svg5-dev libqt5webkit5 libqt5webkit5-dev \
        qtmultimedia5-dev python-protobuf protobuf-compiler libprotobuf-dev xvfb liblo-dev libsndfile1-dev \
        python-soundfile python-numpy libqt5websockets5-dev libgit2-dev libfftw3-dev libssl-dev

2.1.2. Required development packages on fedora

TBD

2.1.3. Installing the libraries manually

You need at least:
- portaudio >= 0.19
- qt >= 5.0

2.1.4. Compilation (after required packages are installed!)

Running
    git submodule init
    git submodule update
    qmake -qt=5 && make
should be enough to get you going.

2.2. Compilation on Windows

If you take the path of least resistance, define a directory layout like the following:

/
  /apex3
  /api
    /qt4
    /portaudio
    /asio (optional)
    /nucleus (optional)
    /fftw3 (optional)
    /sndfile (optional)

Get, compile and install the Qt 4.x library (www.trolltech.com) according to
their instructions. Make sure the appropriate build tools (qmake, uic, moc) are
in the path:
- set the visual studio environment variables by running the vcvars32.bat
    file if necessary
- run qconfigure
- wait :-)

Get, compile and install the portaudio library version v19,
(http://www.portaudio.com/). Put it into the /api/portaudio directory or define
the path in localconfig.pri (see below).
- Delete all folders except wmme from source files->hostapi
- Remove the PaAsio lines from portaudio.def
- Add PA_NO_DS and PA_NO_ASIO to the preprocessor symbols for the project

Get, and install the asio sources
(http://www.steinberg.de/329+M52087573ab0.html). Put it into the /api/portaudio
directory or define the path in localconfig.pri (see below).

Do something similar with the nucleus stuff, fftw3 and sndfile.

Checkout the apex source code into /apex and run qmake. If it worked, you will
see a listing of the found dependencies. If there is something missing although
you installed it, see below.

Run nmake. This should not fail if the qmake step worked. Otherwise file a bug
and assign it to michael.hofmann@med.kuleuven.be.

You can find a project file for VS.NET that calls nmake in
/apex/build/projects.

2.3. Compilation on windows using Mingw

There seems to be an error in the qt build system that results in the
path and filename of the qt tools (such as moc) not being concatenated
correctly. It can be solved by changing line 96 of qmake.conf in the
mingw makespec (called win32-g++) and changing it to:

QMAKE_MOC		= $$[QT_INSTALL_BINS]/moc.exe
QMAKE_UIC		= $$[QT_INSTALL_BINS]/uic.exe
QMAKE_IDC		= $$[QT_INSTALL_BINS]/idc.exe

2.4. Additional Tools

- Install TeX Live:
    http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/install-tl-windows.exe
- Install 7-Zip:
    http://www.7-zip.org/
- Install the latest precompiled Python 2.5 version for Windows:
    https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.5.4
- Install a matching setuptools package:
    https://pypi.python.org/packages/2.5/s/setuptools/setuptools-0.6c11.win32-py2.5.exe

3 Build system

APEX uses a small build system with modular dependencies. A dependency is
defined in a file in /apex/clebs/. They consist of two blocks:

  # Checks whether the dependency is available and adds the name to
  # CLEBS_DEPENDENCIES. Most paths are taken from a qmake variable that can be
  # defined in localconfig.pro.
  clebsCheck(fftw3) {
    win32 {
      isEmpty(FFTW3ROOT):FFTW3ROOT = $$BASEDIR/../api/fftw3
      exists($${FFTW3ROOT}):CLEBS_DEPENDENCIES += fftw3
    }
    unix {
      system(pkg-config fftw3):CLEBS_DEPENDENCIES += fftw3
    }
  }

  # Modifies the necessary qmake variables so that the program links against
  # the right libraries, finds the includes etc.
  clebsDependency(fftw3) {
    win32 {
      INCLUDEPATH += $${FFTW3ROOT}
      LIBS += -L$${FFTW3ROOT} -llibfftw3-3
    }
    unix {
      PKGCONFIG += fftw3
    }
  }

A qmake .pro file that uses the build system need to look a bit like this:

  # Needed modules
  CLEBS *= portaudio jack streamapp pch
  # Include the build system configurations
  !isEmpty(_PRO_FILE_):include(../../clebs/clebs.pri)

  # these are normally set to sensible defaults
  TARGET = ...
  SOURCES += ...
  HEADERS += ...

The qmake definitions in clebs.pri do all the magic and include the neccessary
snippets from /apex/clebs/. You can define some variables that alter the
compile process (change dependency paths, no precompiled headers, release mode)
in localconfig.pri (you can copy it from localconfig-template.pri if it does
not exist).

If you get a message that a dependency was not found, first check
localconfig.pri whether there is a variable that can be defined to locate the
dependency correctly. Otherwise, take a look at the clebs definition in
/apex/clebs/*/dependency.pri to see if you can figure out whats wrong. If you
installed the dependency correctly and it is not possible to solve the problem
with some definitions in localconfig.pri, fix it yourself along the lines
described here (please do not modify clebs.pri) or file a bug and assign it to
michael.hofmann@med.kuleuven.be.
