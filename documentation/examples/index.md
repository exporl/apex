Examples
========

In this chapter we describe four examples: 1) a closed-set
identification task, 2) an adaptive speech in noise identification task,
3) an adaptive just noticeable difference task (gap detection), and 4)
same as 3, but modified to the attention span and interest of young
children. Each example consists of 1) a general description, 2) the
concept, and 3) the implementation in XML.

It is advised to run the experiment before reading the details. The
experiment files are stored in the APEX 4 directory under in the APEX 4
folder, together with sound files and figures of the respective
experiments. Note again: if the experiment file has the extension “.apx”
it remains an XML file that can be edited with OxygenXML. The results
file will automatically have the extension “.results”. *(needs to be
done)*.

Example 1: Closed-set identification of words in noise with figures
-------------------------------------------------------------------

### General description of the experiment

See . This is an example of a closed-set identification test for
children. A word (wave file) is presented and the child responds by
clicking on one of four figures on the screen
(figure \[fig:closedset\]). Subsequently, a new set of figures is shown,
and again, a word corresponding to one of these figures is routed to the
sound card. This is repeated three times. The three words are embedded
in noise at a certain signal-to-noise ratio. In this example the level
of the noise is fixed and the level of the word varies. At the beginning
of the experiment APEX 4 queries for the SNR (signal to noise ratio, in
dB). After having entered this value four figures will appear. Press
Start to start the experiment and to hear the first stimulus (speech in
noise). After the experiment has finished the results are written to a
results file and the percentage correct is determined.

### Conceptual

The experiment as described in the previous paragraph should first be
translated to concepts understood by APEX 4. The main concepts in this
example are *datablock*, *stimulus*, *screen* and *procedure*.
For each of the 3 words to be presented to the subject, a wave file is
available on disk. For each wave file, a datablock is defined, and for
each resulting datablock a stimulus is defined. Everything that is
defined is assigned an ID, to be able to refer to it later on.
Therefore, now we have 3 stimuli with IDs , and .

We should also define the things to be shown on the screen during the
experiment. This is done by defining a screen for each word. Each screen
contains 4 pictures, of which one corresponds to the word. Each screen
again gets an ID, in this case we name the screen by the pictures it
contains. Therefore we now have 3 screens with ID , and .

To indicate the order in which the words should be presented, and
together with which screen, a procedure is defined. In the procedure a
number of trials is defined. Recall that a trial is the combination of a
screen, a stimulus and a correct answer. Therefore a trial is a way to
link each of our stimuli with a screen.

Now only the output logic remains to be defined. The idea is to
continuously present a noise signal and to set the level of the words
such that a certain SNR is obtained. To achieve this, we define 2
filters, the first one is a generator (i.e., a filter without input
channels) that will generate the noise signal. The other one is an
amplifier, which will amplify or attenuate the words to obtain the
desired SNR.

In the following sections each of the elements of the file necessary to
implement the latter concepts will be described in detail. The first one
is .

### Detailed description of various elements

```xml
      <procedure xsi:type="apex:constantProcedure">
        <parameters>
          <presentations>1</presentations>
          <order>sequential</order>
        </parameters>
        <trials>
          <trial id="trial_star">
            <answer>picturestar</answer>
            <screen id="screenstar_horse_vase_moon"/>
            <stimulus id="stimulus_star"/>
          </trial>
          <trial id="trial_fly">
            <answer>picturefly</answer>
            <screen id="screenknee_fly_mouse_star"/>
            <stimulus id="stimulus_fly"/>
          </trial>
          <trial id="trial_mouse">
            <answer>picturemouse</answer>
            <screen id="screenmouse_fly_star_moon"/>
            <stimulus id="stimulus_mouse"/>
          </trial>
        </trials>
      </procedure>
```

The attribute indicates that a constant stimuli procedure is used. This
means that the procedure will select the next trial from the trial list
and that it completes after every trial has been presented a certain
number of times.

-   defines the behavior of the procedure

    -   every trial is presented once

    -   the three trials are presented sequentially, in the order that
        is specified in the experiment file

-   contains different elements to specify a trial. After selecting a
    trial the will show the specified screen and send the stimulus to
    the device. Each trial is given an ID (arbitrary name), eg , such
    that it can be referred to later on or viewed in the results file.

-   the correct answer, to be used by APEX 4 to determine whether the
    subject’s response is correct. Here, the subject gets the
    opportunity to click on one of four pictures. The result from the
    screen (the subject’s response) will be the ID of the element of the
    screen that was clicked. Therefore, in this example, we specify the
    ID of the picture corresponding to the stimulus that is presented.

A trial must be defined for all the words of the experiment.

```xml
        <corrector xsi:type="apex:isequal"/>
```

The corrector checks whether the response is correct or not. The
attribute compares whether the two input values are exactly the same. In
this example compares the answer specified under trial and the ID
corresponding to the picture that has been clicked.

contains several elements that can be referred to elsewhere in the
experiment file (e.g., in above).

-   a relative path is specified here (relative with respect to the
    experiment file). Since APEX 4 knows the location of the experiment
    file, only the folder containing the wave files and pictures must
    be specified. It is also possible to give the absolute path,
    starting at the root. There are three ways to specify a prefix: by
    directly specifying an absolute path, by directly specifying a path
    relative to the experiment file or by referring to a prefix stored
    in . Please refer to [Using prefixes](../creatingexperimentfiles#prefixes) for more information.

-   includes

    -   As the value is a progressbar will be displayed in the right
        hand bottom corner of the screen that indicates the percentage
        of trials that have been completed.

    -   duration of time after response (in msec) that APEX 4 waits
        before presenting the next trial. During this interval, feedback
        can be displayed. In this case, no feedback (thumb up,
        thumb down) is given as the value is .

<!-- -->

-   For each word to be presented, a screen is defined. Each screen has
    an ID by which it can be referred to elsewhere in the experiment
    file (e.g. in to associate it with a stimulus).

    -   specifies how the four figures will be arranged on the screen. A
        GridLayout creates a regular grid on the screen with the
        specified number of rows and columns. In this example there are
        2 rows and 2 columns. Each figure is defined by means of
        a element. Such a definition can be seen as associating a
        graphics file with an ID and specifying at what position of the
        layout it should be shown. In this case, jpeg files are used,
        but other formats are also possible (e.g., png, bmp, gif).

        -   since the prefix as specified under is preprended to each it
            suffices to give the name of the .jpeg file in . The path is
            relative to the experiment file.

    <!-- -->

    -   defines a group of screen elements, namely those (four figures)
        that are displayed on the screen. The ID is defined before.

    -   As many elements can be defined in a screen, APEX 4 has no way to
        know which element contains the subject’s response. If, for
        example, a text box is shown and 2 buttons, it is unclear which
        is to be used to determine whether the answer is correct or not.
        Therefore, in the element is designated that contains the
        subject’s response. In the case of screen elements that are
        clicked in order to respond, the example is further complicated
        by the fact that we cannot specify just one of the elements
        (buttons, pictures), but the response rather comes from a group
        of elements. This is when a can be used to group together
        different screen elements.

A datablock must be made for all wave files used in the experiment,
including the noise (that will be used by the noise generator). In this
example 5 datablocks are defined, 3 for the word files, 1 for the noise
and 1 for silence. contains 5 elements and a prefix.

-   a relative path is specified here. It is also possible to give the
    absolute path, starting at the root (see [Using prefixes](../creatingexperimentfiles#prefixes)).

-   For each wave file a datablock is made, with an ID. In datablock the
    special syntax is demonstrated for creating a datablock containing
    only silence (i.e., all samples are zeros). This is done to put
    silence before and after the word, to prevent the speech and noise
    from starting at the same time. The length of the silence datablock
    is specified in ms after the prefix . It is added before the signal
    (in element ), not before the noise.

-   Each datablock is associated to a (by means of the ID of
    the device).

In the next sections, the output logic will be defined.
Figure \[fig:ex1-output\] gives an overview of the building blocks that
are used in this example. On the left hand side the datablocks are
shown. In the middle the noise generator and the amplifier and on the
right hand side the sound card. As the words are to be amplified or
attenuated according to the desired SNR, the corresponding datablocks
are routed through the amplifier.

![The connection window<span
data-label="fig:ex1-output"></span>](connectionswindow.png)

In the next element the output device is specified.

```xml
     <devices>
        <device id="wavdevice" xsi:type="apex:wavDeviceType">
          <driver>portaudio</driver>
          <card>default</card>
          <channels>1</channels>
          <samplerate>44100</samplerate>
        </device>
      </devices>
```

All devices defined in the experiment file are grouped in . In this
example there is only 1 element. Its ID is set to . As an ID is unique
for an entire experiment file, it can be used later on to refer to this
device.

-   The attribute tells APEX 4 that a sound card is used. The experiment
    only starts if all devices can be opened.

-   specifies the software driver to be used for sound output. If
    unsure, set it to .

-   specifies the name of the sound card to be used. The system default
    card can be used by specifying as a card name. Other card names can
    be defined in .

-   specifies the number of channels of the sound card to be used. The
    number of channels is restricted to the selected sound card, with a
    maximum of 2 for portaudio.

-   the sampling rate of the sound card; Not all sampling rates are
    supported by all devices, and some drivers automatically convert the
    sampling rate. Check your sound card documentation. The sample rate
    of the sound card should correspond to the sampling rates of all
    datablocks used with it. If not, an error message will be shown.

Filters must be defined whenever the signal (or noise) is manipulated.
In this example the level of the noise remains constant and the signal
is amplified or attenuated using an amplifier filter (loop of ).

```xml
    <filters>
        <filter xsi:type="apex:dataloop" id="noisegen"> (*@\label{xml:filter1}@*)
          <device>wavdevice</device>
          <channels>1</channels>
          <continuous>false</continuous>
          <datablock>noisedata</datablock>
          <basegain>-5</basegain>
          <gain id="noisegain">0</gain>
          <randomjump>true</randomjump>
        </filter>
        <filter xsi:type="apex:amplifier" id="amplifier">  (*@\label{xml:filter2}@*)
          <device>wavdevice</device>
          <channels>1</channels>
          <basegain>-5</basegain>
          <gain id="gain">0</gain>
        </filter>
      </filters>
```

contains individual elements, which specify a filter, or as a special
case a generator (i.e., a filter without input channels).

-   on line \[xml:filter1\] the attribute tells APEX 4 that a dataloop
    generator has to be created. This is a generator that takes a
    datablock and loops it infinitely. The datablock to be looped is
    specified by its ID . The dataloop generator itself is assigned the
    ID .

-   on line \[xml:filter2\] the attribute tells APEX 4 that an amplifier
    has to be created. The gain of this amplifier will be varied to
    change the amplitude of the words and thus the SNR. It is assigned
    ID . The gain of the amplifier is made a variable parameter by
    assigning it ID

    -   The device with which the filter is associated

    -   The number of channels of the filter. The available number of
        channels is dependent on the type of filter. An amplifier can
        have any number of channels.

    -   If is set to , the filter or generator will keep on running in
        between two trials (i.e., when the subject is responding). In
        this example it stops when the stimulus stops playing ().

    -   The datablock with ID noisedata, specified under will be looped.

    -   the total gain of the amplifier is basegain+gain. Basegain
        cannot be a parameter, gain can be a parameter. The total gain
        of the complete output system should not be larger than 0 to
        avoid clipping of the signal. This is why basegain = -5.

    -   extent to which the signal is amplified.

    -   If is set to , when the dataloop is started, it will jump to a
        random sample in the datablock. Thereafter it is looped.

```xml
    <stimuli>
        <stimulus id="stimulus_star">
          <datablocks>
            <sequential>
              <datablock id="silence"/>
              <datablock id="datablock_star"/>
              <datablock id="silence"/>

-   can be combined in order (as opposed to .

This is repeated for all the stimuli in the experiment.

```

defines how the different datablocks and filters are routed to the
output device. The ID stands for all the datablocks. In this example
they are routed to the first channel of the filter with ID
<span>amplifier</span> (defined under ). In the amplifier the signal is
amplified or attenuated and sent to the wavdevice on lines \[xml:cha\]
to \[xml:chb\]. At the same time the noise, generated by a generator
with ID noisegen, is sent to the same channel of the wavdevice. The
channels are numbered from 0 onwards. The level of the noise remains
constant and does not pass through an amplifier (lines \[xml:chc\]
to \[xml:chd\]).

A visual representation of connections (see Figure \[fig:ex1-output\])
can be obtained by choosing “Show stimulus connections” under
“Experiment”in the main APEX 4 menu (top left menu bar).

```xml
     <results>
      <page>apex:resultsviewer.html</page>
      <resultparameters/>
      <showduringexperiment>false</showduringexperiment>
      <showafterexperiment>true</showafterexperiment>
     </results>
```

Even if is not specified in the experiment file APEX 4 will deliver a
results file in XML.

-   URL of the html page to show in the results window. The page should
    have the appropriate java script methods embedded. More example
    pages can be found in the APEX 4 resultsviewer folder.

-   Parameters to be passed to the results page. Each parameter will be
    set in hash params.

-   If true, an extra window will be created which will show the results
    of the current experiment while the experiment is being executed.
    Javascript embedded in the page will be executed upon each
    new trial.

-   If true, when the experiment is finished, a dialog box will appear
    querying whether results should be shown. If the answer is
    affirmative, a new window will be opened and the results will be
    shown after javascript processing.

```xml
    <interactive>
       <entry type="int" description="SNR in dB"
        expression="/apex:apex/filters/filter[@id='amplifier']/gain"
        default="0"/>
     </interactive>
```

If a small part of an experiment file has to be changed right before the
start of an experiment (e.g. a start value, a gain value, the subject’s
name), APEX 4 can show the experimenter a small containing the elements
to be changed. This is accomplished by defining the element in the
experiment file.

In this example we will modify the gain of the filter with ID to a value
that is entered by the experimenter at the start of the experiment.

It is only possible to change the value of an existing element of the
experiment file, elements cannot be added. For each element to be
changed, an should be defined under . has four attributes that should be
defined:

-   specifies the type of input element that will be shown. If it is , a
    spinbox[^1] will be shown. If it is a plain text box will be shown.
    In this case a spinbox will be shown as a gain is always numeric.

-   defines the text to be shown in the next to the input element, such
    that the experimenter knows exactly what to fill in.

-   defines the element of the experiment file to be changed. It is
    specified by a so-called XPath expression [^2]. For a description of
    XPath, we refer to the according standard or a good XML book.

-   specifies the default value to be shown in the input element.

Example 2: Identification of speech in noise using an adaptive method
---------------------------------------------------------------------

### General description of the experiment

See . This is an example of an adaptive speech in noise test. It
determines the , the 50 percent correct point, using the 1-down, 1-up
method described by @PM79. In this adaptive procedure the first sentence
is repeated with increasing level until it is identified correctly.
Subsequently, the SRT is determined by increasing or decreasing the
level in steps of 2 dB, according to the last response. Other decision
procedures (eg 2-down 1-up) can also be implemented using APEX 4. In this
example the 5 sentences are scored on the basis of their keywords. The
keywords are indicated in bold on the screen. The experimenter/clinician
is seated in front of the screen and decides whether the subject has
repeated the keywords (of the sentence) correctly, after which the
correct or incorrect button is clicked(figure \[fig:sentencenoise\]). No
feedback is provided. The starting level is given in signal-to noise
ratio (the level of the noise remains the same, that of the signal
varies). In this example speech and noise are routed to the same
channel, i.e. one speaker or one earpiece of the headphone. The results
are written to a results file.

![Example of adaptive sentence in noise experiment<span
data-label="fig:sentencenoise"></span>](example2sentenceinnoise.png)

### Conceptual

The experiment as described in the previous paragraph should first be
translated to concepts understood by APEX 4. The main concepts in this
example are *datablock*, *stimulus*, *screen*, *procedure*, a
*variable* parameter (to change the gain) and *fixed Parameter* to
show a sentence on the screen. For each sentence a datablock is defined,
and for each resulting datablock a stimulus is defined. As always,
everything that is defined, is assigned an ID, to be able to refer to it
later on. In this example there are 5 stimuli with IDs , , , and . The
procedure defines a number of trials. Recall that a trial is the
combination of a screen (always the same in this example), a stimulus
and a response.

As we are dealing with an adaptive procedure a fixed or variable
parameter is adapted. In this example a variable parameter is adapted to
change the gain of the sentence, and a fixed parameter is used to show a
sentence on the screen. The screen also shows the signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR) under test and the response alternatives “correct” and
“incorrect”.

Now only the output logic remains to be defined. The idea is to
continuously present a noise signal and to vary the level of the
sentences adaptively. To achieve this, we define 2 filters, the first
one is a generator (i.e., a filter without input channels) that will
generate the noise signal. The other one is an amplifier, which will
amplify or attenuate the sentences to obtain the desired SNR. Both are
connected to one channel of the wavdevice.

In the following sections each of the elements of the XML file necessary
to implement the latter concepts will be described in detail.

The attribute of refers to a procedure in which a parameter is changed
according to the response of the subject. In this example the gain of
the amplifier is adapted. The procedure selects the next trial from the
trial list and it completes after every trial has been presented a
certain number of times.

-   defines the behavior of the procedure

    -   every trial is presented once

    -   the trials are presented sequentially, in the order that is
        specified in the experiment file (if would be specified, they
        would be presented in random order).

    -   the corrector checks whether the response is correct or not. The
        attribute compares whether the two input values are exactly
        the same. In this example compares the answer specified under
        trial () and the ID corresponding to the picture that has been
        clicked (either or ).

    -   the level is increased after n (here 1) incorrect response(s);
        cf

    -   the level is decreased after n (here 1) correct response(s); cf

    -   to be adapted

    -   the experiment starts with gain=0 (input of user). The value
        here will be replaced by the entry value. Please refer to
        section \[sec:Interactive\] for more information.

    -   the experiment stops after a specified number of presentations
        of each trial is completed (it is also possible to stop after .

    -   the experiment stops after 1 presentation of each trial

    -   If , then larger values of the parameter are easier than
        smaller values. It is used to determine and .

    -   the first trial is repeated with increasing gain until it is
        identified correctly.

    -   from the beginning of the experiment (begin=0) the stepsize is
        2 dB.

-   contains different elements to specify a trial. Once a trial is
    selected, will show the specified screen and send the stimulus to
    the device. Each trial is given an ID (arbitrary name), eg , such
    that it can be referred to later on or viewed in the results file. A
    trial must be defined for all the sentences of the experiment.

-   the correct answer, to be used by APEX 4 to determine whether the
    subject’s response is correct. In this example the experimenter will
    click on “correct” or “incorrect”. The result from the screen will
    be the ID of the element of the screen that was clicked ( or ).

contains element that is referred to in .

-   includes elements on progress and feedback

    -   If the value is a progress bar will be displayed in the right
        hand bottom corner of the screen that indicates the percentage
        of trials that have been completed.

    -   duration of the time after response (in msec) that APEX 4 waits
        before presenting the next trial. During this interval feedback
        can be displayed. In this example, no feedback (thumb up,
        thumb down) is given as the value is .

-   the screen has an ID by which it can be referred to in each trial.
    In this example the screen displays four blocks in the top left
    corner to indicate the SNR and the sentence. In addition, the labels
    “Correct” and “Incorrect” are displayed on the buttons at the bottom
    of the screen (cfr screenshot, figure...).

    -   places elements in an irregular grid. The screen is divided into
        sections according to the values. In this example there are two
        nested layouts. The main layout divides the screen in two main
        rows (height = 2, width = 1). The parameter layout divides the
        first of these rows in four rows and four columns, of which only
        the two first ones are filled. The answer layout divides the
        second main row in two columns, each with one button. The
        stretch factor for the columns is a list of integers, separated
        by comma’s. There should be as many integers as columns. The
        width of the columns is proportional to the numbers. With , and
        implies that the second row will be twice as wide as the
        first one. If , and and the second column will be four times as
        wide as the first and two times as wide as the 3rd and 4th. With
        the 3rd and 4th rows will be twice as wide as the 1st and 2nd.

    -   the labels on the left are fixed and display the “SNR” and
        “Sentence”. The button “Correct” and “Incorrect” are indicated
        at the bottom of the screen

    -   the blocks on the right display the values of the
        fixed parameters. Gain is the (variable) SNR level, and sentence
        is a fixed parameter, defined in

    -   can be specified in points

    -   defines a group of screen elements (those that are displayed on
        the screen). As many elements can be defined in a screen, APEX 4
        has no way to know which element contains the
        subject’s response. Therefore, in the element is designated that
        contains the subject’s response. In the case of screen elements
        that are clicked in order to respond, the example is further
        complicated by the fact that we cannot specify just one of the
        elements (one button, one picture), but that the response rather
        comes from a group of elements. This is when a can be used to
        group together different screen elements.

contains a list of elements and a prefix.

-   a relative path is specified here (relative with respect to the
    experiment file). Since APEX 4 knows the location of the experiment
    file, only the folder containing the wave files and pictures must
    be specified. It is also possible to give the absolute path,
    starting at the root. There are 3 ways to specify a prefix: by
    directly specifying an absolute path, by directly specifying a path
    relative to the experiment file or by referring to a prefix stored
    in . Please refer to [Using prefixes](../creatingexperimentfiles#prefixes) for more information.

-   for each wave file a datablock is made, with an ID.

    In datablock the special syntax is demonstrated for creating a
    datablock containing only silence (i.e., zeros). This is done to put
    silence before and after the sentence, to prevent the speech and
    noise from starting at the same time. The length of the silence
    datablock is specified in ms after the prefix . It is added before
    the signal (in element ), not before the noise.

    -   the datablock is associated with the sound card with ID , as
        defined in the section.

    -   the URI is appended to the prefix defined above

```xml
    <devices>
        <device id="wavdevice" xsi:type="apex:wavDeviceType">
        <driver>portaudio</driver>
        <card>default</card>
        <channels>1</channels>
        <samplerate>44100</samplerate>
        </device>
    </devices>
```

All devices defined in the experiment file are grouped in .The ID is set
to . As an ID is unique for an entire experiment file, it can be used
later on to refer to this device (eg in datablocks).

-   the attribute tells APEX 4 that a sound card is used. The experiment
    only starts if all devices can be opened.

-   specifies the software driver to be used for sound output. If
    unsure, set it to .

-   specifies the name of the sound card to be used. The system default
    card can be used by specifying as a card name. Other card names can
    be defined in .

-   the sampling frequency of the sound card. Not all sampling rates are
    supported by all devices, and some drivers automatically convert the
    sampling rate. Check your sound card documentation. The sample rate
    of the sound card should correspond to the sampling rates of all
    used with it.

```

contains individual elements, which specify a filter, or as a special
case a generator (i.e., a filter without input channels).

-   The attribute tells APEX 4 that a dataloop generator has to
    be created. This is a generator that takes a datablock and loops
    it infinitely. The datablock to be looped is specified by its ID .

-   on line \[xml:filter2\] the attribute tells APEX 4 that an amplifier
    has to be created. The gain of this amplifier will be varied to
    change the amplitude of the words and thus the SNR. It is assigned
    ID . The gain of the amplifier is made a variable parameter by
    assigning it ID

    -   the device with which the filter is associated

    -   The number of channels of the filter. The available number of
        channels depends on the type of filter. An amplifier can have
        any number of channels.

    -   If set to the noise is presented during the speech, but not
        during the subject’s response.

    -   the datablock with ID noisedata, specified under will be looped.

    -   : the total gain of the amplifier is basegain+gain. The total
        gain of the complete output system should not be larger than 0
        to avoid clipping of the signal. This is why basegain = -5.

    -   the gain value that is changed. E.g. if the targetamplitude is
        65 dB SPL (see Calibration) the signal and noise have equal
        amplitude if gain = 0. Gain is changed by other modules.

    -   If is set to , when the dataloop is started, it will jump to a
        random sample in the datablock. Thereafter it is looped.

-   defines how the different datablocks and filters are routed to the
    output device. The ID stands for all the datablocks. In this example
    they are routed to the first channel of the filter with ID
    <span>amplifier</span> (defined under ). In the amplifier the signal
    is amplified or attenuated and sent to the wavdevice on
    lines \[xml:ch1\] to \[xml:ch2\]. At the same time the noise,
    generated by a generator with ID noisegen, is sent to the same
    channel of the wavdevice. The channels are numbered from 0 onwards.
    The level of the noise remains constant and does not pass through an
    amplifier (lines \[xml:ch3\] to  \[xml:ch4\]). Although noisedata is
    a and connected to *amplifier* it is not specified in and does not
    pass through *amplifier*.

A visual representation of connections can be obtained by choosing “Show
stimulus connections” under “Experiment”in the main APEX 4 menu (top left
menu bar).

```

Even if is not specified in the experiment file APEX 4 will save a
results file in XML.

-   URL of the html page to show in the results window. The page should
    have the appropriate java script methods embedded. More example
    pages can be found in the APEX 4 resultsviewer folder.

-   Parameters to be passed to the results page. Each parameter will be
    set in hash params. In this example, the result will be calculated
    as the mean of the variable parameter (gap) at the last 4 reversals.

-   If true, an extra window will be created which will show the results
    of the current experiment while the experiment is being executed.
    Javascript embedded in the page will be executed upon each
    new trial.

-   If true, when the experiment is finished, a dialog box will appear
    querying whether results should be shown. If the answer is
    affirmative, a new window will be opened and the results will be
    shown after javascript processing.

```

If a small part of an experiment file has to be changed right before the
start of an experiment (e.g. a start value, a gain value, the subject’s
name), APEX 4 can show the experimenter a small containing the elements
to be changed. This is accomplished by defining the element in the
experiment file.

In this example we will modify the gain of the filter with ID to a value
that is entered by the experimenter at the start of the experiment.

-   a value is entered, here corresponding to SNR in dB. It is also
    possible to enter a string, e.g. name of the subject (see
    Reference Manual).

-   the interactive window will show 4 as default value; more than one
    entry may be defined.

Example 3: Gap detection: determining the Just Noticeable Difference
--------------------------------------------------------------------

### General description of the experiment

See . This is an example of a gap detection task: two stimuli are
presented to the listener in random order, a stationary noise and an
interrupted noise. During the presentation the intervals are
highlighted. The subject’s task is to indicate the interval with the
interruption(figure \[fig:gapdetection\]). Feedback is provided (thumb
up, thumb down) and the minimal detectable gap is determined by means of
an adaptive procedure (here 2-down, 1-up). Stimuli (wave files) are
generated off line. This example only includes 5 wave files. Usually
many more are generated. The results are written to a text file.

![Example of adaptive gap detection experiment<span
data-label="fig:gapdetection"></span>](example3gapdetection.png)

### Conceptual

The experiment as described in the previous paragraph should first be
translated to concepts understood by APEX 4. The main concepts used here
are *procedure*, *screens*, *datablocks* and *stimuli*.

For each wave file (noise with or without a gap) a is defined, and for
each datablock a is defined. In this example there are 5 wave files,
with gap sizes ranging between 1 and 5 ms. Their IDs are , , , and . In
an adaptive procedure either a fixed or variable parameter is defined.
In this example a fixed parameter is used, i.e. the gap size in the
stimulus. The wave files with different gap sizes are stored on disk,
and are assigned a certain gap value. This gap value is used to
determine the gap threshold. Also, a is defined that shows the two
response intervals indicating “1” and “2”.

To indicate the order in which the stimuli should be presented a is
defined. An adaptive procedure is defined containing 1 with five
variable stimuli (with gap) and the standard stimulus without the gap.
Recall that a is the combination of a (always the same in this example),
a stimulus and a correct answer. The standard and stimuli occur randomly
in one of both intervals.

Now only the output logic remains to be defined. The idea is to present
the standard and a variable stimulus after each other, and the stimulus
to be presented depends on the response of the subject. Filters are not
used since the signals are not changed.

In the following sections each of the elements of the XML file necessary
to implement the latter concepts will be described in detail.

```

The attribute refers to a procedure in which a parameter is changed
according to the response of the subject. In this example 1 trial is
defined with different stimuli from which the adaptive procedure
chooses.

-   defines the behavior of the procedure (eg., nr of presentations,
    order of presentation, response strategy).

    -   every trial is presented once.

    -   applies to the order of the trials. Since there is only 1 , it
        does not matter here wether the order is specified as or .

    -   the corrector checks whether the response is correct or not. In
        this example the number of choices in was 2. This means that
        will present the target stimulus in either interval 1 or 2.
        informs about the correct interval. also receives the clicked
        button from the screen and looks up the corresponding number in
        the element above and compares it with the number it received
        from .

    -   number of alternatives to choose from (here: 2 intervals) and
        the IDs of the buttons (defined under they correspond to.

    -   a pause of 1000 ms will be introduced between successive wave
        files;

    -   number of items after incorrect trials to increase the gap

    -   number of items after correct trials to decrease the gap

    -   the gap size cannot be smaller than 0.

    -   the gap size cannot be larger than 5

    -   the parameter to change, here the “gap”, see also

    -   the gap at which to start, here 5, see under

    -   reversals (it can also stop after a number of presentations
        or trials)

    -   number of reversals after which the procedure is stopped

    -   the number of reversals that are used for the average threshold

    -   here (the smaller the gap, the more difficult the task)

    -   the stepsize

    <!-- -->

    -   the is changed after a specified number of reversals. In this
        example a stimulus is skipped until the second reversal (start
        at 5, then 3, etc). Thereafter no stimulus is skipped.

-   only 1 trial is defined

    -   the ID of the trial

    -   the ID of the screen

    -   the ID of the stimulus

    -   the ID of the standard

-   contains several screen elements that can be referred to elsewhere
    in the experiment file (e.g. in above).

-   includes elements on progress and feedback

    -   if a progress bar will be displayed in the right hand bottom
        corner of the screen. The progress bar can indicate the
        percentage of trials that have been done or it shows when a
        reversal occurs in an adaptive procedure. In the latter case the
        progress bar will increase at every reversal while the number of
        trials varies.

    -   duration of the time after response (in msec) that APEX 4 waits
        before presenting the next trial. During this interval feedback
        can be displayed.

    -   if the interval is highlighted while a signal is presented.

-   each screen has an ID by which it can be referred to elsewhere in
    the experiment. In this example the screen displays two intervals.

    -   places elements in an irregular grid. The screen is divided into
        sections according to the values. In this example there is an
        equal number of rows (x) and columns (y).

        Gridlayout defines a group of screen elements (those that are
        displayed on the screen).

        -   for each interval a button is specified; this
            button (interval) displays a number on the screen

        -   the left interval denotes “1”, the right one denotes “2”.

    -   defines a group of screen elements (those that are displayed on
        the screen). As many elements can be defined in a screen, APEX 4
        has no way to know which element contains the
        subject’s response. Therefore, in the element is designated that
        contains the subject’s response. In the case of screen elements
        that are clicked in order to respond, the example is further
        complicated by the fact that we cannot specify just one of the
        elements (one button, one picture), but that the response rather
        comes from a group of elements. This is when a can be used to
        group together different screen elements.

    of the experiment file, only the folder containing the wave files
    and pictures must be specified.

-   for each wave file a unique datablock is defined by an ID. The
    standard signal (uninterrupted noise) must also be specified here.

-   each datablock includes the audio device to which the signal is
    routed

-   since the path is defined in it is not necessary to specify the
    entire path again

all devices defined in the experiment file are grouped in the . Only 1
is used in this example. The ID is set to soundcard. As an ID is unique
for an entire experiment file, it can be used later on to refer to this
device.

-   the attribute tells APEX 4 that a sound card is used. The experiment
    only starts if all devices can be opened.

-   specifies the software driver to be used for sound output. If
    unsure, set it to .

-   specifies the name of the sound card to be used. The system default
    card can be used by specifying as a card name. Other card names can
    be defined in ApexConfig.

-   2 channels are specified here, because the signal is stereo.

-   the sampling frequency of the wave files. Not all sampling rates are
    supported by all devices, and some drivers automatically convert the
    sampling rate. Check your sound card documentation. The sample rate
    of the sound card should correspond to the sampling rates of all
    datablocks used with it.

defines the auditory events, e.g. noise with gap and noise without gap.

-   -   the gap is a fixed parameter that is identified by an ID

-   this element includes a description of the (variable) stimulus

    -   -   the ID refers to the wave file corresponding to the
        datablock

    -   -   includes information on the size of the variable gap

```

-   defines how the different datablocks and filters are routed to the
    output device. The ID stands for all the datablocks. In this example
    they are routed to 1 channel of the wavdevice.

A visual representation of connections can be obtained by choosing “Show
stimulus connections” under “Experiment”in the main APEX 4 menu (top left
menu bar).

```xml
    <results>

      <showafterexperiment>true</showafterexperiment>
     </results>
```

Even if is not specified in the experiment file APEX 4 will save a
results file in XML. The results file will display the correct answers,
the reversals, the entire sequence of responses, and the average
threshold based on the number of reversals and the magnitude of the
corresponding gap parameter specified in the experiment file.

-   URL of the html page to show in the results window. The page should
    have the appropriate java script methods embedded. More example
    pages can be found in the APEX 4 resultsviewer folder.

-   Parameters to be passed to the results page. Each parameter will be
    set in hash params.

-   If , an extra window will be created which will show the results of
    the current experiment while the experiment is being executed.
    Javascript embedded in the page will be executed upon each
    new trial.

-   If , when the experiment is finished, a dialog box will appear
    querying whether results should be shown. If the answer is
    affirmative, a new window will be opened and the results will be
    shown after javascript processing.

    been shown.

Example 4: Gap detection in child mode
--------------------------------------

### General description of the experiment

See . This is an example of a gap detection task adapted to the interest
of children: two stimuli are presented to the listener in random order,
a stationary noise and an interrupted noise. It is the same experiment
as example 3, but pictures (movies) of cars replace buttons on the
screen, and a smiley panel is shown (figure \[fig:gapchild\]). During
the presentation of stimuli the cars are animated. The child’s task is
to indicate the stimulus with the interruption. Feedback is provided by
smileys and the minimal detectable gap is determined by means of an
adaptive procedure (here 2-down, 1-up). Only those elements that are
specific to the child mode are described in this example.

![Example of gap detection in child mode<span
data-label="fig:gapchild"></span>](example4gapdetectionchild.png)

### Conceptual

The main concepts illustrated in this example are *childmode*, and
*reinforcement*. Child mode involves a different panel, and
intro/outro movies.

-   a relative path is specified here (relative with respect to the
    experiment file). This only applies to the movies in . There are 3
    ways to specify a prefix: by directly specifying an absolute path,
    by directly specifying a path relative to the experiment file or by
    referring to a prefix stored in . Please refer to
    [Using prefixes](../creatingexperimentfiles#prefixes) for more information.

-   -   if a panel will be shown with smileys (see figure *presented
        above*)

-   -   If a progress bar will be displayed on the right hand side
        with smileys. The progress bar shows when a reversal occurs in
        an adaptive procedure (while the number of trials varies).

    -   duration of the time after response (in msec) that APEX 4 waits
        before presenting the next trial. During this interval feedback
        can be displayed

    -   the interval is highlighted while a signal is presented. In this
        childfriendly example, the car corresponding to the present
        interval is moving.

-   replaces the “standard” panel, sets some defaults, enables
    intro/outro movies and changes the background colour

    -   the name of the movie file, per frame (smileys and panel are a
        collection of frames)

Each screen has an ID by which it can be referred to elsewhere in the
experiment. In this example the screen displays two movies, each
containing a car.

-   places elements in an irregular grid. The screen is divided into
    sections according to the values. In this example there are two
    columns and one row.

    -   replaces of the standard version

        -   the name of the flash movie file on disk, for the case
            without animation (still car).

        -   -   the name of the movie file indicating the present
                interval is active (here the moving car)

            -   the name of the movie file following a correct response
                (here a monkey waving)

            -   the name of the movie file following an incorrect
                response (the trunk of an elephant)

-   defines a group of screen elements (those that are displayed on
    the screen). As many elements can be defined in a screen, APEX 4 has
    no way to know which element contains the subject’s response.
    Therefore, in the element is designated that contains the
    subject’s response. In the case of screen elements that are clicked
    in order to respond, the example is further complicated by the fact
    that we cannot specify just one of the elements (buttons, pictures),
    but that the response rather comes from a group of elements. This is
    when a can be used to group together different screen elements.
